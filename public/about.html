<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>I am an Entry-Level Full Stack Web Developer with a strong foundation in front-end development, data management, 
  and process automation. With hands-on experience in building responsive web interfaces and improving workflow 
  efficiency, I’m focused on developing clean, maintainable, and user-friendly solutions.</p>

  <p>Throughout my roles in web development, content publishing, and data operations, I’ve worked with HTML, CSS, 
    JavaScript, Bootstrap, and PHP to create and enhance user-facing features. I also have practical experience in 
    Excel VBA automation—building tools that consolidate files, streamline reporting, and reduce repetitive manual 
    tasks by up to 70%. My background in QA testing, troubleshooting, and system navigation further strengthens my 
    ability to deliver accurate, reliable work.</p>

<p>I’m tech-savvy, quick to learn new tools, and highly detail-oriented. My experience spans data entry, content 
  management, report automation, and front-end coding, making me adaptable across both development and administrative
  environments.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m applying for roles that will give me meaningful experience, help me strengthen my full stack 
  capabilities, and support my long-term growth as a web developer. I’m always exploring new technologies and 
  continuously improving my skills to build efficient, scalable solutions.</p>
